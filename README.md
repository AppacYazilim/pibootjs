# Boot my pi project


This is a project to port the existing https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot to webusb. 

The goal is to be able to boot a raspberry pi 5 from a web browser.

Right now we can boot a raspberry pi 5 to a specific linux image that provides a mass storage device to the host computer.

This way you can image the raspberry pi 5 form your pc without the need of a microsd card reader or removing the microsd card from the raspberry pi 5.
